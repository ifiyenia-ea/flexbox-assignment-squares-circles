/* I was NOT able to change the size of the squares
    using flexbox commands ... Stretch wouldn't
    work at all in any way; grow would only happen
    on the main axis (but this has helped me understand
    the grow and shrink etc better).
    
    Also not sure whether I was meant to align the text
    this way; I tried several different flexbox commands
    but yet again, it wouldn't work. I'm sure there are 
    plenty of things wrong or in the way in my code which
    prevent this, but unfortunately I can't figure it out 
    
    Latest (last?) update regarding the stretching:
    Is it maybe because I have given the squares its
    sizes?
